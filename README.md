# Introduction
This app is aimed at counting points in math and physics competitions.
The app consists of three windows: one for viewing the scores, one for entering the results, and one for entering the jolly (only one for team).  
It also saves all variations of the total points and saves that in a .txt file in the same directory, to make grafic read above.
